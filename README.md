# Cookcademy - SwiftUI and Firebase Project

Submitted by: **Ibrahim Awoleiro**

This Swift app was part of my Swift Path on Codecademy.

## Overview

Welcome to **Build an Intermediate iOS App with SwiftUI**! In this Skill Path, I learned how to use more Swift language tools like closures and generics, and how to put together robust user interfaces with SwiftUI view structures like Form, List, and Sheet. Amidst all these new topics, I built a cumulative iOS project named **Cookcademy**.

**Cookcademy** is a recipe application where users can view, create, edit, favorite, and save recipes. Over the course of the skill path, I added features to Cookcademy while learning more about Swift and SwiftUI.

Cookcademy is built using Xcode 12.5.1 and Swift 5. Make sure that you have Xcode installed and open as you explore the project.

SwiftUI is an exciting framework, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share my progress on building this iOS application. Let's get started!
